As you know, you **CAN’T** grant authorization in the name of third parties or entities (for out-of-scope testing) without their permission and consent. If the hunter finds a bug on a third-party component, sharing the report with such a third-party without any legal assurances (just good faith) on whether *they* will pursue legal action against the hunter is not very nice on your behalf. Consider a commitment to attempt to gain such authorization prior to sharing. Other legal issues may arise here as well (such as copyright license in the report).

## Template third-party disclaimer

> We will not share your report with a third-party without gaining their commitment they will not pursue legal action against you or initiate contact with law enforcement about your report. Please note again that we cannot authorize out-of-scope testing in the name of third parties and such testing is beyond the scope of this policy. Refer to the third party's bug bounty policy, or contact the third party either directly or through a legal representative before intiating any testing on that third party.
