## Template third-party disclaimer

If you submit a report through our bug bounty program which affects a third party service, we will not share your identifying information with any affected third party without your written permission. After notifying you that we intend to do so, we may report non-identifying content from your report with an affected third party, but only after getting their written commitment not to pursue legal action against you or initiate contact with law enforcement based on your report.

Please note that we cannot authorize out-of-scope testing in the name of third parties, and such testing is beyond the scope of our policy. Refer to that third party's bug bounty policy, if they have one, or contact the third party either directly or through a legal representative before intiating any testing on that third party or their services. This is not, and should not be understood as, any agreement on our part to defend, indemnify, or otherwise protect you from any third party action based on your actions.

> **Note:** As you know, you **CANâ€™T** grant authorization in the name of third parties or entities (for out-of-scope testing) without their explicit permission and consent. If the hunter finds a bug on a third party component, sharing the report with such a third party without any legal assurances (just good faith) on whether *they* will pursue legal action against the hunter is not very nice on your behalf. Consider a commitment to attempt to gain such authorization prior to sharing. Other legal issues may arise here as well (such as copyright license in the report).
