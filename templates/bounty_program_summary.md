### Bounty Program 

`Company` provides a bug bounty to better engage with security researchers. The idea is simple: hackers and security researchers find and report vulnerabilities through our responsible disclosure process through our bug bounty program, we review those reports, and reward researchers appropriately.

### Rules for you 

* Don't attempt to gain access to another user's account or data. If you are attempting to find an authorization bypass, please use accounts you own, control, or are fully authorized to use.

* Don't perform any attack that could harm the reliability/integrity of any of our services or data. DDoS/spam attacks are **not** allowed.

* Don't publicly disclose a bug before it has been fixed.

* Only test for vulnerabilities on sites and subdomains you know to be operated by `Company`. Some sites hosted on subdomains of `Company` are operated by third parties, e.g. `Example Subdomain`, and should not be tested.

* Do your best not to impact other users with your testing.

* Don't use scanners, scrapers, or any other automated tools in your testing. They're noisy and we may suspend your account and/or ban your IP address.

* Never attempt non-technical attacks such as social engineering, phishing, or physical attacks against our employees, users, or infrastructure.

* When reporting vulnerabilities, please keep all information within your report. Do not post information to other platforms like video-sharing or pastebin sites.

* When in doubt, contact us at `contact@company.com`.

### Rules for us

* We will respond as quickly as possible to your submission.

* We will keep you updated as we work to fix the bug you submitted.

* We will not intiate or encourage legal action against you if you play by the rules.

### What does not qualify?

* Bugs that don't affect the latest version of modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). Bugs related to browser extensions are also out of scope.

* Bugs requiring exceedingly unlikely user interaction.

* Submissions which don't include steps to reproduce the bug, or only include those steps in video form.

* Bugs, such as timing attacks, that prove the existence of a private repository or user.

* Insecure cookie settings for non-sensitive cookies.

* Disclosure of public information and information that does not present significant risk.

* Bugs that have already been submitted by another user, that we are already aware of, or that have been [classified as ineligible](/ineligible.html).

* Bugs in applications not listed under our Open Bounties List are generally not eligible. Look at individual bounties for details on scope.

* Bugs in content/services that are not owned/operated by `Company`. This includes our users' code, users' sites, and third party services operating on subdomains of `Company`.

* Vulnerabilities that `Company` determines to be an accepted risk will not be eligible for a paid bounty or listing on the site.

* Scripting or other automation and brute forcing of intended functionality.

* When in doubt, contact us at `contact@company.com`.
