The below safe harbor language is based on Amit Elazari's general academic research in this field, the DOJ guidelines on this issue (which you must read! - https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips/page/file/983996/download) and some leading policies like Dropbox.

## Template 1: Explicit safe harbor with good faith violations

> **Summary:** We want you to responsibly disclose through our bug bounty program, and don't want researchers put in legal fear for good faith attempts to comply with our bug bounty policy. We cannot bind any third party, so do not assume that protection extends to any third party. If in doubt, contact us first about any specific research action if you think it _might_ be outside the bounds of our policy. If in doubt, ask first!

> To encourage responsible disclosure, we will not pursue civil action or initiate notice to law enforcement for accidental or good faith violations of this policy. We consider security research and vulnerability disclosure activities conducted consistent with this policy to constitute “authorized” conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the DMCA, and other applicable computer use laws such as Cal. Penal Code 502(c). We waive any DMCA claim against you for circumventing the technological measures we have used to protect the applications in scope.
>
> If legal action is initiated by a third party against you and you have sufficiently complied with this bug bounty policy (i.e. have not made intentional or bad faith violations), we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.
>
> Please understand that if your security research involves the networks, systems, information, applications, products, or services of another party (which is not us), we cannot bind that third party, and they may pursue legal action or law enforcement notice. We cannot and do not authorize security research in the name of other entities.
>
> You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws. 
>
> Please submit a report to us before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent with or unaddressed by this policy. If in doubt, ask first!
