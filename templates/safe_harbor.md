## Template 1: Explicit safe harbor with good faith violations

**Summary:** We want you to responsibly disclose through our bug bounty program, and don't want researchers put in legal fear because of their good faith attempts to comply with our bug bounty policy. We cannot bind any third party, so do not assume this protection extends to any third party. If in doubt, ask us before engaging in any specific action if you think it _might_ go outside the bounds of our policy.

**Terms:** To encourage research and responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities, we will not pursue civil or criminal action, or send notice to law enforcement for accidental or good faith violations of this policy. We consider security research and vulnerability disclosure activities conducted consistent with this policy as “authorized” conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the DMCA, and other applicable computer use laws such as Cal. Penal Code 502(c). We waive any potential DMCA claim against you for circumventing the technological measures we have used to protect the applications in this bug bounty program's scope.

Please understand that if your security research involves the networks, systems, information, applications, products, or services of a third party (which is not us), we cannot bind that third party, and they may pursue legal action or law enforcement notice. We cannot and do not authorize security research in the name of other entities, and cannot in any way defend, indemnify, or otherwise protect you from any third party action based on your actions.

That said, if legal action is initiated by a third party, including law enforcement, against you because of your participation in this bug bounty program, and you have sufficiently complied with our bug bounty policy (i.e. have not made intentional or bad faith violations), we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.

You are expected, as always, to comply with all laws applicable to you, and not to disrupt or compromise any data beyond what this bug bounty program permits.

Please contact us before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent with or unaddressed by this policy. We reserve the sole right to make the determination of whether a violation of this policy is accidental or in good faith, and proactive contact to us before engaging in any action is a significant factor in that decision. If in doubt, ask us first!

> **Note:** This safe harbor on its own does _not_ prevent sending notice to a third party about a vulnerability found on their service. There is [separate safe harbor language](safe_harbor_third_party.md) for that which could be dropped in.
The above safe harbor language is based on Amit Elazari's general academic research in this field, the DOJ guidelines on this issue (which are worth reading but entirely too prosecution-friendly - https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips/page/file/983996/download) and leading policies such as [Dropbox's HackerOne terms](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/03/protecting-security-researchers/).
