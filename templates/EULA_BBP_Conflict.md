To the extent your activities are inconsistent with certain restrictions in our `SITE POLICY`, we waive those restrictions for the limited purpose of permitting your security research under this bug bounty program.

For `SITE POLICY`, list each applicable policy that may conflict, or link to a policy/terms landing page if this is intended to supersede all of them (n.b.: it probably is not). Ideally, link each agreement directly.

**Attribution:** this structure and general form is from Amit Elazari's #LegalBugBounty program, but the specific language is based on Dropbox's policy carveout from their [terms on HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/dropbox)
