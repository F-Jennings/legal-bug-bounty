To the extent your activities are inconsistent with certain restrictions in our `SITE POLICY`, we waive those restrictions for the limited purpose of permitting your security research under this bug bounty program.

**Note:** For `SITE POLICY`, list each applicable policy that may conflict, or link to a policy/terms landing page if this is intended to supersede all of them (it probably is not). Ideally, link each agreement directly. (e.g., "certain restrictions in our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Acceptable Use Policy, ...")

**Attribution:** this structure and general form is from Amit Elazari's #LegalBugBounty program, but the specific language is based on Dropbox's policy carveout from their [terms on HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/dropbox)
